Speckle desktop client installer for:

- Grasshopper
- Rhino
- Dynamo
- (NEW) [SpeckleCoreGeometry](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleCoreGeometry) 

The installer does not require admin privileges and auto updates!

## Creating a new (pre) release

1. Change version in `appveyor.yml` file
2. Commit & tag commit with the new version
3. Push to origin

To push the newly minted pre-release, you'll need to edit it and change its status from `prerelease` to `release`.

## Installer tool
This project uses [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/) to create the installer.

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please first head over to [Inno Setup download page](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) and install it.
